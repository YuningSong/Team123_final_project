111,112,Dennis Schroder,"Look at Michael Beasley's college numbers. Seems like a 0% fail chance based on the numbers. He failed. So, what's the answer? There's no such thing as a 0% fail chance.

There's significantly more randomness in the draft process than anybody likes to acknowledge. If a guy has a 99% chance to succeed, he's got a 1% chance to fail, and 1% chances hit sometimes. It's especially random in this era because for a ton of guys, they're an NBA player if they shoot 35% from 3 and a G-leaguer if they shoot 30%. That's a difference of 1 make every 20 shots. You're essentially trying to predict who will shoot 7/20 from 3 vs. 6/20 from 3. You can look at the numbers, you can look at the form, you can look at whatever you want, but there's no great way to predict.

One thing I will say though is that highly drafted combo forwards almost always disappoint. D. Williams, M. Williams, Beasley, Bennett, Parker (though that was injury related), MKG, Wes Johnson, I could keep going. The list of true combo forwards who are more than roleplayers is really really short. It's why I'm concerned about Zion - as amazing as he is, I have no idea what his NBA role is on either side of the ball at the next level, and while I think he'll put up defensive stats, I think he's at an elevated risk of role-related failure.",28,TheDuckyNinja,elead5c,1555813415.0

113,114,Derrick Favors,"I've been a student at the University of Iowa the last four years, and I'm really glad Devyn was drafted. He's always been a fan favorite, and comes off as a great guy. 

As far as his game goes, I've always referred to him as Kobe Bryant lite. He's best at creating his own shot, whether it be a jumper or dribble penetration, and can go on incredible hot streaks (he just about single-handedly carried us to the NIT championship last year). He can also handle the ball well and pass decently (he played PG for us at times), is fairly athletic, and plays decent defense with a knack for jumping passing lanes. However, his one downside is he can go quiet, whether it be missed shots or lack of aggression.

I think he has a very NBA-ready game, without tremendous upside, but could definitely be a solid, contributing bench player, eventually a solid sixth man. Hopefully he sticks with you guys and you can enjoy his game as much as I have!",13,Nijo32,cii8h51,1403842031.0

>Yes. Fuck yes. Green has a lot of flaws but very happy with this as I didn't even expect a replacement signing and our current financial situation sucks.

>I appreciated the Ennis minutes at Zalgiris away and he looked better than I thought but I might prefer Green over Ennis straight up, forget him being an injury replacement.

>With his outside shooting ability, there's no way his off-ball offense problems will surface under Zeljko. He'll mostly be an off-ball player which is fine as we cannot trust him making reads. Important thing is we won't have to rely on to get minutes from Sloukas' backups, Dixon and Guler, in a long season because they are both old and have questionable durability at this point. Even though I love Dixon, it is what it is.

>Only question mark is he underperformed at Oly, his only other season with a F4 contender. My counter would be he isn't as needed here, he'll be an injury replacement. That wasn't the case with his Oly season. And Oly offense still was worse when they didn't pick up his option and replaced him with Brian Roberts instead next year. That tells he's not Brian Roberts levels bad offensively.

>I like it. He's an injury replacement. His shooting will be enhanced. He's not a slasher but he should get the occasional close-out attacks and whatnot within our pass traffic. Despite the encouraging signs from Ennis at the Zalgiris game, I straight up trust Green more. At least I know what I'm getting with him.

>Everyone arguing this doesn't solve our creation problems doesn't realize that Ennis wasn't providing that anyway and Green is his injury replacement, not an offseason signing in a vacuum.

Really appreciate an injury replacement signing of this caliber from our board. Thought we would have to go with what we have after the Ennis injury with our financial situation. ",5,lavta,e8d3hvq,1540394803.0

I've got a bunch, answer as many as you're comfortable answering.  
    

 * First off, lemme start with an easy one - you guys have got $60 tees. There are a lot of tees on the market. Why should we buy yours? I'm not against a $60 tee in concept, and I've bought $60 tees before, but obviously you're trying to sell based on fabric and construction rather than design. What are you guys doing better than the alternatives? How do we know you're not just another brand trying to slap the ""premium"" label on slightly-above-average clothes?   
 * Similarly, if I'm thinking of a reference point for your tees, it's probably the sort of stuff we see at Division Road, Standard & Strange, etc. Which is great stuff. How does a Modern Cotton tee compare to those tees which emphasize construction with a bit more of a repro angle?  
 * Are there any other brands you look to - either from a product perspective or a marketing perspective - as reference points, or that helped you think about what you wanted Modern Cotton to be? Are there any brands where you think ""if somebody likes [X], they'll probably like us?""   
 * How much of a product pipeline do you have in the works right now? How often will you roll out new product? If you had to give a ballpark number of the total time between an idea on a page (or a good suggestion from the community) and a finished product, what would that be?   
 * Blake specifically, I'm curious...how do you think your work in technical garments, and your work on the larger-scale manufacturing side of things, applies here?

Here's Danny Green on the difficulty of playing Game 3 after the death of Gregg Popovich's wife:

She had a presence. You guys are intimidated by Pop and probably scared of him, but her presence is probably the total opposite of that; just a joy to be around, lightened the room up and made you smile, and made everybody feel comfortable. Pop probably makes you guys a little uncomfortable. It's tough. It just puts things into perspective of how it was a basketball game. We were obviously competing and fighting, but it's a basketball game. There's bigger things going on in life. We had a tough year. Joffrey [Lauvergne] just had a family member pass. Kyle [Anderson] had a family member pass. Rasual Butler earlier this year -- a lot of guys knew him well -- and now Pop. It just puts things into perspective. As much as we want to win, there are other things in life, bigger things that are more important.""

408,409,Russ Smith,"Another active player, another boring episode. Just have more coaches, more retired players for fuck's sake. 

Also I'm sick of all the American talk with the American guests. This interview lasted almost 90 minutes and there was like 20 minutes of Euroball talk. With every American guest, there's a lot of American youth basketball, NCAA and so on talk that nobody cares. Hell, I'm an NBA fan but I don't even care about NBA discussions of these guests. It's always the same shit over and over with Arlauckas kissing the guest's ass with bullshit like ""yeah you've been in tough situation man, unfortunate man"". 

Having a 90 min interview with 20 mins of Euroball talk is hilariously bad. And for American players, Arlauckas always does the same shit over and over ""You probably think what am I doing here when you first come in right? hahaha"". That's his fucking Euroball talk when you can ask so many interesting questions to Shane here. Only interesting part was Shane talking about Copa del Rey and Barcelona's offer in 2017.

There has been 5 times the baseball talk in this episode compared to Efes talk which is fucking unbelievable. Who the fuck cares about baseball in this podcast's audience?",1,lavta,el3tekk,1555512842.0
