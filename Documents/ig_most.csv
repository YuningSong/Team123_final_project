I always dreamed to play with the greatest basketball players, not only with those that are best on the court, but those that are also great leaders

#ManuGinobili is one of them. I consider him my idol and one of the basketball heroes, especially for us latins. His talents changed basketball in the US and opened the doors for Latinos in basketball.

He achieved the goals he had set forth and he is one of the best international basketball players in the history of the #nba

It was an honor to have the opportunity to play against him in the #nba and national team. I will always remember his professionalism, discipline and the moments we shared after each game.

#GraciasManu for representing the Latino community and demonstrating that we can achieve our goals. THANK YOU"

Damn! Damn! Damn! When i got the news yesterday before the game it reminded me when I got the news about my sister. It hit my heart straight on!!! I just spoke to you a few days ago cuz like this can’t be real. It seemed like our careers took off at the same time, I listened to your music EVERYDAY since ‘08 and we built our friendship up ever since then. You been REAL since day 1 and always showed me genuine love! You touched more lives than you would ever imagine and got people through real life situations by just being who you are... This is one of the toughest post I’ve ever had to make, I didn’t want to believe anything that I was hearing and I still don’t. You really had the world running they MARATHON! I remember every time I came by the shop to show love to you and the homies y’all would walk me to my car and tell me “Be safe out here”. This hit home and I pray that God protects your family, your kids and the whole HOOD. You inspired a whole generation with your music and what you stood for, no matter who you were or how your life was you could relate to what Nip was speaking through his music whether you was in the streets, a athlete, doctor it didn’t matter because it was about grindin for whatever you believed in! The world felt this shit and it will never be the same but ima do everything I can to keep this MARATHON life going. All Money IN no money OUT! Thank you for changing the world @nipseyhussle “So if it’s meant, than it’s gon be People love it, cause they know that it’s the real me The cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me But I don’t want the fame, I just want y’all to feel me It’s my time, so I’m going in We ball till we fall, F*** how the story ends We see these niggas hatin’ I know you hoes plotting I ain't worried bout it Cause I know God got me”

127,602470996,dubai,polandfinnest,vacation,plane,atlantis,Lecąc do polski miałem przyjemność podróżować w towarzystwie naszego mistrza i legendy TOMKA GOLLOBA. I muszę przyznać ze było to dla mnie ogromne emocjonalne doświadczenie z lekcja pokory w jednym.Przegadaliśmy polowe podróży o naszych karierach i oczywiście o samym wypadku. Czułem się zdewastowany wiedząc ze w żaden sposób nie mogłem pomoc osobie która podziwiałem dojrzewając na łódzkich balutach. Często jest tak ze trzeba zebrać pieniądze.... wykonać telefon.... załatwić coś przez znajomość albo po prostu porozmawiać. Żadna z tych rzeczy nic nie daje Tomkowi:( on potrzebuje poprostu cudu!!! 🙏🏼 Czemu to pisze ... ponieważ wielu z nas włącznie ze mną nie zdawaliśmy sobie sprawy jakie ludzie maja durne problemy w życiu. Z czym musza się mierzyć każdego ranka jak otwierają oczy. Wydaje nam się ze bóle stawów.... mała pensja .... brak czegos w życiu to rzeczy które niszczą nasze samopoczucie każdego dnia i wielu z nas uważa ze świat się wali na głowę. A ja polecam wam wstać każdego dnia i DOCENIĆ to ze jesteście zdrowi i możecie chodzić i widzieć. DOCENCIE to co macie i kogo macie wokół siebie. A może dostrzeżecie w swojej sytuacji/życiu trochę pozytywów. Kiedyś zapytał mnie znajomy jak ci się udało dostać do NBA ... miałeś szczęście.? A ja odpowiedziałem krótko.... poprostu ZAPIERDALAŁEM. Kiedy inni narzekali... patrzyli innym na ręce albo wynajdowali kolejna wymówkę to ja byłem skoncentrowany na moim działaniach i celu. 💪🏼👌🏼 dlatego taka moja mała sugestia dla was ludziska zróbcie to samo.  To na tyle od Doktora Gortata. Codziennie modlę się o Tomka i trzymam za niego kciuki zróbcie proszę to samo. #polandFinnest #lot @flylot

No matter what the situation is, you’re always still your goofy/spunky/funny self. Having you by my side gives me the confidence to overcome anything because I know at the end of the day you’ll find a way to put a smile on my face and make me laugh like you do in all these pics/videos 😂 and because it’s your birthday, I get to share your unbelievable singing and dancing moments with the world so they can smile and laugh with me too haha! Happy birthday beautiful!! I love you so so so much! ♥️♥️♥️"

Across a total of 17,398 miles to be exact. But when the people need you for a bucket and the passport could use a few more stamps... you can’t turn down opportunities like this! The story gets crazier by the day, but I’m looking forward to being back out here in Spain for a little. Got a lot to prove! Let’s get it @cbbreogan ✊🏽💯🇪🇸"

You’re my brother, my favorite player, my idol. I cant wait to really sit down with you and talk about how this year felt and the emotions that went into it all. Im not going to lie I was mad that I didn’t get a chance to have a jersey swap with you and everyone else did because I wanted to share that special moment with you but if I sit back and really think about it we’ve had so many special moments already I can’t even count. Man you’re the reason I knew I could play this game at the highest level and your the reason why I know I can achieve every goal I want in this league. Yes you’re a role model but you’re more than that to me your my friend, my vet, and my hero! Thank you for all you’ve done for this game and thank you for all you’ve done for me. The dance is over but everyone will always remember the legacy(and the dance moves lol 🕺🏽)you left behind you are truly a #LivingLegend #OneLastDance #Flash #Dwade #Family @dwyanewade"
